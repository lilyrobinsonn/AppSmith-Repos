## A brief introduction to Hello Happy
Hello Happy is a journal app that allows users to keep track of their daily activities and habits while keeping their therapist in the loop. Therapists can have administrative control over certain users, granting them access to observe the day-to-day elements that shape a patient's day. Users also have the option to use the app solely as a personal journal, without linking it to a therapist. The app offers input fields for users to log their daily activities, helping them identify patterns in their days. The files in this project repository create our hello-happy database and populate it with fake data.

## Navigating the UI
- Intially opening Hello Happy's AppSmith application will take you to a page where you can select which type of user you are: _a returning user__, _returning therapist____, or a _new user/therpist_!
- Follow the steps given on each page and play around to explore Happy Hello. The app will haave many different pages to schedule a therapist meeting, create a new journal entry, check your current progress on your personal goals and more!

**Happy exploring!**
